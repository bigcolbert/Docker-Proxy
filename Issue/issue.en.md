## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Problem Summary

#### 1. Unable to delete a specific image tag through the UI.
**Known IssueÔºö** Deletion is not supported when using `registry` as a proxy cache.

**Related IssuesÔºö** [#3853](https://github.com/distribution/distribution/issues/3853)

#### 2. The pull speed from within China is not ideal.
**Known IssueÔºö** The network route from your foreign server to China is suboptimal.

**SolutionsÔºö** 
- (1) Enable BBR on the server to optimize network performance (with limited effect).
- (2) Switch to a server that has better network optimization for routes to China.

#### 3. How long does the registry image cache last, and how to adjust it?
**Known IssueÔºö** The default cache time is 168 hours, which is 7 days. Adjust the cache time by modifying the ttl in the proxy configuration section of the configuration file

#### 4. Regarding the solution for pulling images from the 'Hub' public namespace with or without adding the 'library' prefix when using a mirror registry for acceleration.

- This scheme was provided by a senior member in the communication group and has been implemented and tested through Nginx.
```shell
http {
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        ''      close;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name hub.your_domain.com;

        # Âú®docker hubÁöÑÈÖçÁΩÆ‰∏≠Ê∑ªÂä†‰∏ãÈù¢ÁöÑlocationËßÑÂàô
        location ~ ^/v2/([^/]+)/(manifests|blobs)/(.*)$ {
            rewrite ^/v2/(.*)$ /v2/library/$1 break;
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:51000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header REMOTE-HOST $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            add_header X-Cache $upstream_cache_status;
        }

        location  / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:51000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header REMOTE-HOST $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            add_header X-Cache $upstream_cache_status;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 5. An error occurs when pulling an image `tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`

**Known IssueÔºö** Certificate issue. Indicates that the certificate was issued by an unknown or untrusted certificate Authority (CA).
